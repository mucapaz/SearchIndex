Vans and Minivans 2016-2017: The Best and the Rest

    EPA: 21 (Est) city/24 (Est) hwy

    Chevrolet City Express
    MSRP: $22,950 - $24,510
    EPA: 24 city/26 hwy
    Overview: Lurking behind the bow tie on the grille is a Nissan NV200, but that’s not all bad.

    EPA: 21 (Est) city/29 (Est) hwy

    MSRP: $27,835 - $40,905
    EPA: N/A

    EPA: N/A

    EPA: 18 city/24 hwy
    Overview: Snazzy, sporty, and striking aren’t words you associate with minivans—but the ambitious folks at Kia have managed to bake a little of each into the Sedona.
    Toyota Sienna
    MSRP: $29,790 - $47,350
    EPA: 19 city/27 hwy

    Nissan Quest
    MSRP: $27,480 - $44,130
    EPA: 20 city/27 hwy
    Overview: Settling for a minivan doesn’t mean surrendering to boring design; the Quest is a prime example of this thesis.
