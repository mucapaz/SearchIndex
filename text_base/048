    MSRP: $25,750
    EPA: 122 city/93 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: The Smart Fortwo ED should be the most logical and painless of the EV conversions, but we have tested it and found it lacking.

    MSRP: $38,300 - $44,010

    Volkswagen Eos
    MSRP: $32,860

    MSRP: $290,475 - $323,520
    EPA: 13 city/21 hwy
