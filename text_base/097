The 2015 Honda Accord is sold here in three variants with two different engine sizes – two 2.0-litre and one 2.4-litre. The entry level 2.0 VTi starts at RM137,010, while the top of the range 2.4 VTi-L is priced at RM173,055. Honda’s D-segmenter competes with the likes of Suzuki Kizashi, Kia Optima, Toyota Camry, Peugeot 508, Nissan Teana, Hyundai Sonata and Mazda 6 Sedan.

Powering the entry and mid-level executive saloon is a naturally aspirated 2.0-litre four-pot that churns out 155hp at 6,500rpm and 190Nm of torque at 4,300rpm. The top of the line model however benefits from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated motor that is rated at 175hp and 225Nm of torque. Drive is sent to the front wheels via an electronically controlled five-speed torque converter automatic transmission with Shift Hold Control function.

17-inch alloy wheels are standard on the 2.0-litre variants, while the higher displacement model gets 18-inchers.  Standard across the range are front fog lights, LED daytime running lights, turn signal integrated side mirrors, auto on/off headlamps and LED rear lights.

Exclusive to the most expensive Accord 2.4 VTi-L variant is equipment such as auto levelling LED headlights, paddle shifters, an auto dim rear view mirror, driver and passenger electric seats and power rear sunshade.

Safety wise all 2015 Honda Accord variants come equipped with dual front SRS airbags,  Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), hill start assist, ABS with EBD and Brake Assist, rear and front sensors.
