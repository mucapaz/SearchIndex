A full used buyer’s guide on the Lexus CT 200h covering the CT 200h Mk1 (2011-date)
Verdict
When Lexus introduced the CT 200h, it was touted as “the world’s first full hybrid luxury compact car”. However, after 12 months with an F-Sport model we weren’t convinced. While the seats were comfortable and the economy superb (we achieved up to 76mpg), the whiny transmission and numb steering weren’t so welcome. Still, even if the car didn’t shine dynamically, the free road tax and superb dealer service we encountered show that the CT can make a lot of sense. It may not be fun to drive, but it’s an easy car to own.

On paper, the CT 200h was a stroke of genius from Lexus. When it launched in 2011, sister brand Toyota was already enjoying huge success with the hybrid Prius. However, while that car was popular, it wasn’t especially luxurious.

The premium brand’s answer was to take the Prius’ petrol/electric running gear and put it into a bespoke body that mixed luxury with sharper looks – and the CT 200h was born.

Sadly, the execution wasn’t as good as the concept, with the driving experience and interior quality not to the level we’d hoped for. Upgrades have made the CT more of a contender, though, so while it’s no class leader, it still makes a great used buy.
Models covered

The Lexus CT 200h arrived in early 2011 and has now been on sale for over five years. It’s still in its first generation, although it did receive a facelift in 2014.

History

The CT 200h arrived in UK showrooms in February 2011, claiming 94g/km CO2 emissions. There was a choice of three trim levels (SE-I, SE-L and SE-L Premier) with the racier and more plush F-Sport appearing in January 2012. A year later, the high-value Advance was launched, along with the entry-level S – the latter promised 87g/km of CO2. The trim hierarchy was revamped as well (now SE, Luxury and Premier).

A facelifted CT 200h was introduced in March 2014 with styling changes, a revised chassis (for an improved ride) and extra standard equipment, plus lower prices.

At the same time, CO2 emissions for the S model were cut to just 82g/km. The high-spec Advance Plus from spring 2015 brought sat-nav, metallic paint and a sunroof.

Which one should I buy?

There’s very little to separate the various CT 200h models apart from trim level, as they’re all the same mechanically. That means a 1.8-litre petrol engine backed up by an electric motor to give 134bhp, with all cars featuring a CVT automatic gearbox.

As you’d expect of a Lexus, most CTs have plenty of standard kit; all get alloy wheels, Bluetooth, dual-zone climate control and automatic wipers as standard. The SE-L adds leather trim and heated front seats, while top-spec cars feature cruise control (adaptive cruise was optional), sat-nav, 13-speaker hi-fi, plus electrically adjustable front seats. LED headlights and a rear parking camera were also included, along with auto-dimming door mirrors. 
Alternatives to the Lexus CT200h

Until the arrival of the Volkswagen Golf GTE at the end of 2014, the CT had the hybrid luxury hatch market almost to itself. Just weeks after the Golf went on sale, it was joined by the Audi A3 e-tron Sportback.

Both cars offer five-door hatchback practicality with a petrol/electric hybrid drivetrain. However, as they’re still so new, prices are high. The Golf starts at £26,000, while the cheapest Audis are £27,000. Yet both models are more impressive than the Lexus. Meanwhile, the Toyota Prius is more practical and delivers better performance for less money, although it’s not as plush.

The Citroen DS5 hybrid is stylish and well equipped, and it’s also unique in this group in that it has a diesel/electric powertrain. 
What to look for:
Fuel economy

The CT’s official fuel economy figure is 68.9mpg. Some owners have got close to this when trying, but expect 50-55mpg in everyday driving.

Rattles

Because the CT is so quiet on the move, every minor noise in the cabin is noticeable, such as rattles from the cup-holders. 
Stereo

A lot of CT owners aren’t very impressed with the performance of the standard-fit stereo systems. Even the upgrades can be underwhelming. 
Spare wheel

As with many modern cars, instead of a spare wheel of any kind, there’s a tyre mobility kit. Some overseas-market models get a space saver, though. 
Interior

There are lots of toys and the build quality is good, while the seats are among the comfiest in any car of this size. Cabin space is good and the boot is roomy, even though it has to accommodate the hybrid powertrain – there’s 375 litres with the seats up, or 985 litres when they’re folded.

Running costs

Unsurprisingly, the CT 200h follows the same service schedule as the Toyota Prius Mk3, so maintenance is required every 12 months or 10,000 miles. Check-ups alternate between Intermediate (which is little more than an oil and filter change, plus a visual inspection) and Full, with prices at £195 and £345 respectively.

At 60,000 miles, a more comprehensive service is required (which costs £445), then the biggest comes at 100,000 miles (£545). As the CT’s engine is chain-driven, there’s no timing belt to change. The brake fluid needs replacing every two years and the coolant every 10 years or 100,000 miles, but this is included in the service costs.

Recalls

The CT 200h hasn’t been the subject of a single recall since it was introduced, which speaks volumes. In fact, it’s the only Lexus not to have been called back in that time.

The brand has issued eight recalls since the start of 2011, with the IS, GS, LS and RX involved in at least one each. Potential problems have included airbag failures, fuel leaks and power-steering glitches. But none of these things has affected the CT, so buyers can focus solely on carrying out the usual checks on their potential purchase.
Driver Power owner satisfaction

The CT finished 42nd in our Driver Power 2016 satisfaction survey, a drop of just five places from 2015. Owners love the build quality (9th), ease of driving (19th) and road handling (30th). The flies in the ointment are practicality (118th) and ride quality (100th).
