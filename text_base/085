Overview

The Ferrari 488 GTB is the successor to the much loved 458 Italia, but it is quite different to the car it replaces. Although it retains the mid-engined layout, the V8 mill in the 488 GTB is downsized and turbocharged. It carries a starting price of RM1,068,800 (excluding duty and options) and competes with models such as the Lamborghini Huracan and McLaren 650S.

Powering the 2015 Ferrari 488 GTB is a newly developed 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8 mill that outputs 661hp at 8000rpm and 760Nm of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is employed to sent the power to the rear wheels. This turbocharged Italian horse does the century sprint in just 3.0 seconds, while the top speed is in excess of 330km/h.
