2016 Porsche Boxster Review

    Full Review Photos Prices Specs Performance Interior Safety Reliability 

By Carter MacLeod July 13, 2016

The 2016 Porsche Boxster offers one of the most satisfying driving experiences in its price range, based on the expert reviews and data that inform our rankings. It's possible to get a car that's faster in a straight line, but few will be as nimble.

The Boxster combines its sharp handling with a spacious, comfortable, and luxurious interior, making it a good car for commuting. Long-distance cruises will be nearly as enjoyable as quick jaunts down twisting roads. The Boxster's road trip potential is only limited by its cargo space, which is split between two small trunks.

The Boxster is on the pricier side for a small German roadster. The Audi TT, BMW Z4, and Mercedes-Benz SLK are all less expensive. However, none of those cars can match the Boxster’s dexterity or its superb reliability rating, which predicts many years of maintenance-free motoring.
Boxster Performance
Magnificent Handling

The Boxster feels quicker going through a corner than most rival sports cars; its steering is responsive and the car stays flat, even at higher cornering speeds. Great tire grip aids agility, as does the Boxster's midengine design, which centers the car's weight between its front and rear wheels. Powerful brakes scrub speed quickly. Don't think the Boxster's performance capabilities make it uncomfortable to drive. The suspension is tuned to deliver a firm but smooth ride.
Base Engine Is Lively, Could Be Livelier

The base Boxster is certainly quick with its 265-horsepower 2.7-liter six-cylinder engine, but some $50,000 sports cars are quicker. For example, the BMW M235i convertible costs less ($48,750) and has 55 more horsepower.
Optional Engines Up the Ante

Though it commands a hefty $11,800 premium, the Boxster S delivers noticeably stronger acceleration thanks to its 315-horsepower 3.4-liter six-cylinder engine. The GTS' 330-horsepower mill bumps up straight-line performance further. The range-topping Spyder has the 3.8-liter six-cylinder engine from the $99,000 Porsche 911 Carrera S, slightly detuned to produce 375 horsepower. It's a true performance machine, though it is missing key standard comfort features like air conditioning and a stereo.
Slick Transmissions

The Boxster comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission that's great fun to shift. The dual-clutch automatic (PDK in Porsche-speak) shifts more quickly than you ever could and is also a great choice. It also gets better fuel economy.
Fuel Economy

The 2016 Porsche Boxster gets 20 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway with its base engine and manual transmission. That's slightly worse than its main German rivals, the Audi TT Roadster (23/30 mpg city/highway), Mercedes-Benz SLK (25/32 mpg city/highway), and BMW Z4 (22/34 mpg city/highway), all of which have more-efficient turbocharged four-cylinder engines. If you order the automatic transmission, fuel economy improves to 22/32 mpg city/highway.

Boxster Interior
Premium Materials

Everywhere you look or touch, the Boxster offers materials that are commensurate with its $52,100 price point, making the car as enjoyable to sit in as it is to drive. Even the base model's plastic panels feel upscale and will make you wonder whether it's worth it to spring for the optional leather package.
Supportive and Spacious Seats

In a sports car as agile as the Boxster, supportive seats are paramount. The Boxster’s seats provide ample lateral support, so you won't slide around as you're cornering, and hours of comfort, which makes them great for long highway cruises.

The Boxster looks small from the outside, but fear not if you're on the taller side. The seats have height, sliding, and reclining adjustments and should easily accommodate you.
Two Trunks Aren't Better Than One

Because the Boxster's engine is located in the middle of the car, the Boxster has two trunks, one in the front and one in the back. The rear trunk has 4.4 cubic feet of cargo space, and the front trunk has 5.3.

The combined cargo capacity of the two trunks is on par with that of rivals like the BMW Z4 (8 cubic feet) and Audi TT (9.9 cubic feet). However, because the Boxster's cargo space is split between two trunks, larger items like golf clubs won't fit. The Boxster also has limited storage space in its cabin. At least the Boxster's trunk space isn't reduced when you fold down the convertible top, as it is in most rivals.
User-Friendly Dashboard Controls

The Boxster has straightforward controls for its audio and climate systems; the buttons are where you expect to find them, and major settings like radio tuning and audio volume get their own knobs.

A 7-inch touch screen is the central component of the dashboard. Its graphics look dated, but it functions as well as any system on the market. In addition to the main touch screen, the Boxster has a display in its gauge cluster that shows useful information like tire pressure, engine specs, and navigation maps.
Top-Down Driving on the Move

While some rival convertibles, such as the BMW Z4 and Mercedes-Benz SLK, require you to drive slowly or come to a full stop to lower the top, the Porsche Boxster's top can be lowered at speeds of up to 31 mph. That's a big help if you're driving in city traffic and get the sudden urge to feel the wind in your hair.

Boxster Pricing, Options, and Trims

The 2016 Porsche Boxster comes in five trims: base, Black Edition, S, GTS, and Spyder.
Base

The Porsche Boxster's starting price is $52,100, which is on the mid to high end for a two-seat luxury roadster. The Boxster's fellow German rivals, the Audi TT Roadster ($46,400), Mercedes-Benz SLK ($47,000), and BMW Z4 ($49,700), all undercut it in price. The Alfa Romeo 4C Spider ($65,900) is significantly more expensive. The Chevrolet Corvette convertible ($59,400) and Jaguar F-Type convertible ($68,100) are more expensive as well, though they are more directly competitive with the Boxster's pricier sibling, the Porsche 911 Cabriolet ($96,200). The slightly more expensive Porsche Cayman ($52,600) is almost identical to the Boxster but without the convertible top.

Standard features in the base model include a power-operated convertible fabric top, a 265-horsepower six-cylinder engine, rear-wheel drive, a six-speed manual transmission, faux leather upholstery, seats with manual height and sliding adjustment and power-adjustable seatbacks, a four-speaker audio system, Bluetooth, and an infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen.

Numerous options are available on the base model Boxster, but be careful. The Boxster's price can climb quickly when you start checking those boxes on the order form.
Black Edition

The new Black Edition ($59,100) has the same powertrain as the base trim. It's only available with black paint and has standard features that are options in the base model, including dual-zone automatic climate control, larger wheels, front and rear parking sensors, heated seats, and an upgraded infotainment system with navigation and a seven-speaker stereo.
S

The Boxster S ($63,900) has a larger six-cylinder engine, which bumps horsepower from 265 to 315. It has almost the same standard features as the base Boxster, meaning that most of the $11,800 price premium is going toward that extra 50 horsepower.
GTS

The Boxster GTS ($74,600) ups the performance ante further with a tuned version of the S' six-cylinder that produces 330 horsepower. The GTS also adds a few sporty standard features that are options on lower trims, such as a sportier-sounding exhaust system and Porsche's PASM adaptive suspension, which lets you adjust the suspension stiffness for a sportier or more comfortable ride.
Spyder

The new Spyder ($82,100) is the most hard-edged, performance-oriented trim in the Boxster lineup and better suited for weekend track days than daily commutes. It has a detuned version of the Porsche 911 Carrera S' six-cylinder and makes 375 horsepower.

In an effort to cut down on agility-killing weight, the Boxster Spyder has fewer comfort features than the other trims. The convertible top is manually folding, the door handles have been replaced by fabric straps, and there's no stereo or air conditioning (though they can be added at no extra charge). The Spyder also has a stiffer suspension.

Boxster Safety and Reliability

The 2016 Porsche Boxster has relatively few advanced safety features. It's available with a rearview camera, front and rear parking sensors, and an adaptive cruise control system that can maintain a set following distance from the car in front of you by automatically applying the gas and brakes.

The rival 2016 Mercedes-Benz SLK has a much broader array of safety features, including automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, a system that coaches you into a parallel parking spot, and a standard driver drowsiness monitoring system.

The 2016 Porsche Boxster earned the top reliability score from J.D. Power, indicating that its predicted reliability is far above average for the class. Porsche covers the 2016 Boxster with a four-year/50,000-mile warranty.

Other Cars to Consider

The BMW M235i convertible earns rave reviews for its handling, and its base model undercuts the Boxster's base price by $3,350. In addition to the savings, you get two extra seats (albeit tiny ones) and 55 extra horsepower. The 2-Series' interior isn't quite as luxurious as the Boxster's, but it still offers comfortable and supportive front seats and a premium vibe.

The Chevrolet Corvette convertible costs a little less than a Boxster S, and you get a lot more horsepower for your money – 140 horsepower, to be precise. The Corvette's potent standard V8 isn't the only trick the car has up its sleeve. It also has impressive cornering abilities, commendable braking power, and responsive steering. A comfortable ride makes the Corvette a great weekend cruiser, and its 10-cubic-foot trunk makes it a more luggage-friendly choice than the Boxster.
