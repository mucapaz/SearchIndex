    Overview: Sun worshippers and Mini mavens continue to find this convertible irresistible—and can you blame them?

    MSRP: $20,180 - $23,985
    EPA: 23 city/31 hwy
    Overview: If you’re among the rare subset of buyers who want a car that looks sporty but isn’t exactly muscular, then the tC fills the bill.

    MSRP: $19,090 - $24,390
    EPA: 25 city/34 hwy
    Overview: Sensible, spacious, and trustworthy—these traits make the Impreza a safe choice, but not an exciting one.

    EPA: 28 (Est) city/37 (Est) hwy

    MSRP: $20,415 - $36,870
    EPA: 25 (Est) city/34 (Est) hwy
    Overview: Its shape is among the most distinctive on the road; surprisingly, the Beetle, offered as a coupe or a convertible, is as fun to drive as it looks.

    MSRP: $18,500 - $31,940
    EPA: 28 city/40 hwy

    MSRP: $16,725 - $22,000

    Overview: A flexible interior, an efficient powertrain, and agreeable pricing make the Fit an easy recommendation.
    Scion iA
    MSRP: $16,495 - $17,595
    EPA: 31 city/41 hwy
    Overview: The iA has daring looks and a long list of amenities that make it hard to call it basic transportation.
    Chevrolet Sonic

    MSRP: $14,830 - $17,830
    EPA: 33 city/40 hwy

    MSRP: $15,065 - $19,545
    EPA: 27 (Est) city/36 (Est) hwy

    Toyota Yaris
    MSRP: $15,760 - $18,535
    EPA: 30 city/36 hwy
    Overview: A budget car that feels every bit of its low sticker price, the Yaris is an afterthought in a competitive segment.
