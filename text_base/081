Overview

The 2016 BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is a five-seater, compact, multi-purpose vehicle directly rivals model the Mercedes-Benz B-Class. Available here in the 218i guise, the Active Tourer is BMW’s first foray into the segment, and the brand’s first-ever front-wheel drive model. Price to own the this first ever front wheel drive Bavarian model is RM218, 800. For customers who wants a little bit more uniqueness there is also a RM30,000 Luxury Line package that adds 18-inch Y-spoke alloy wheels, various chrome exterior trim pieces and more. 

Despite the 218i nameplate which may suggest a larger 1.6 or 2.0-litre four pot, powering the Active Tourer MPV is a 1.5-litre three-cylinder BMW TwinPower turbo engine which delivers 136hp at 4,400rpm and 220Nm of torque between 1,250 to 4,300rpm. While tuned uniquely here, the all-new BMW engine in the Active Tourer shares much of its components with the BMW i8 sports car (where it delivers 231hp, before the electric motors boost total output to 362hp), and several MINI and BMW variants. Power is sent to the front wheels via a new six-speed Aisin-sourced torque converter type automatic transmission.
