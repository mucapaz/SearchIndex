2016 Audi A6 Review

    Full Review Photos Prices Specs Performance Interior Safety Reliability 

By Carter Macleod June 17, 2016

The 2016 Audi A6 is one of the most well-rounded midsize luxury sedans you can buy, based on the expert reviews and data that drive our rankings. It's quick, fuel-efficient, and has a top-notch interior with a class-leading design and loads of high-tech options. Its safety scores are among the best in the segment. It also undercuts its main German rivals, the Mercedes E-Class and BMW 5-Series, by several thousand dollars.

There are rivals that offer cushier rides – the E-Class, for one – and the A6 can't match the bargain pricing of the excellent Hyundai Genesis. However, in terms of elegance and poise in the midsize class, you can't do much better than the A6.
A6 Interior
Striking Design

The Audi A6 has one of the nicest cabins in the class. One reviewer goes so far as to argue that its interior design is rivaled only by the $96,000 Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

The A6's build quality is faultless. The cabin is appointed with the finest materials, including real wood and aluminum trim. The A6's high-tech features have finely wrought controls and displays that are integrated into the dashboard with elegant simplicity. Your friends will be impressed.
Spacious Seating

The A6's front seats are comfortable and supportive, and they remain so even as the miles accumulate on long trips. The rear seats have more legroom than most rivals, accommodate 6-footers comfortably, and are able to carry three adults side by side without difficulty. The bottom rear-seat cushion is a bit low, however, and taller people may wish they had more thigh support.
Up-to-Date Infotainment

The centerpiece of the A6's dashboard is the MMI infotainment system. It works similarly to many infotainment systems in the luxury class – there is a screen in the center of the dashboard that you control using a knob on the center console. There's no touch-screen functionality.

The on-screen menus are easy to navigate, and the writing on the screen is crisp. Volume and temperature are controlled by separate knobs, and other major settings, like audio track selection, get their own buttons. Reviewers agree that the system is easy to use overall, though some say the systems in Mercedes and BMW vehicles are even more intuitive.

As you step into higher trims, you get a dizzying array of cutting-edge features. Purchasing the Technology Package ($3,100) gets you an upgraded MMI infotainment system with a larger screen, navigation, a touchpad that lets you write out addresses with your finger, and Audi Connect, which provides a wireless hot spot that can support up to eight Wi-Fi-equipped devices and enables the navigation system to display Google Earth satellite imagery.

The MMI has an upgraded processor this year, which improves response times and allows it to display sleek 3-D graphics. A head-up display, which projects your speed onto the windshield, and a night vision camera, add to the high-tech bonanza.
Average Trunk Space

At 14.1 cubic feet, trunk space in the A6 is about average for the class. A narrow opening limits the width of the objects you can fit. However, the A6's rear seats fold down to accommodate longer items. If you need more trunk space, the Jaguar XF has 19.1 cubic feet.

A6 Performance
Poised Handling

Whether on a straight highway cruise or a curvy rural road, the 2016 Audi A6 can keep up with its most agile rivals. Automotive journalists report that driving the A6 feels like driving a smaller car. The A6's strong brakes and available Quattro all-wheel drive system help as well, although all-wheel drive isn't necessary for driving excitement. The base front-wheel drive model handles well too.
Firm (and Firmer) Suspensions

There is a tradeoff for this handling prowess. The A6 has a firmer ride than some rivals. Comfort-oriented cruisers like the Mercedes E-Class and Hyundai Genesis will roll more smoothly over bumps and potholes. This is especially true if the A6 is fitted with the optional sport suspension or extra-large 20-inch wheels.

That's not to say that the A6's ride is unforgiving. You may actually appreciate the firmness, which lends the A6 a buttoned-down, Teutonic feel that can make it seem both sportier and more premium than the average sedan. Still, if ride comfort is priority No. 1, make sure you test-drive the aforementioned alternatives.
Base 2.0T Engine: Powerful and Fuel-Efficient

The A6's base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is retuned for 2016 and is up 32 horsepower to 252. It feels extremely powerful, yet delivers the excellent fuel economy that you'd expect from a small engine. The base A6 2.0T with front-wheel drive gets 24 mpg in the city and 35 on the highway. That's better than almost all six-cylinder rivals and most four-cylinder rivals as well, including the BMW 528i and Cadillac CTS 2.0T.
Midrange 3.0T Engine: Ditto

The midtier 3.0T trim has a 333-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V6. This engine is more powerful than the base 2.0T, but it doesn’t give up much in the way of fuel economy. The 3.0T, which comes with all-wheel drive, gets 20 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway. That's better than most rivals, including the Mercedes E350 4Matic, BMW 535i xDrive, and Cadillac CTS 3.6 AWD.

It costs about $5,300 to upgrade to a 3.0T from a comparably equipped 2.0T, and the 2.0-liter mill is no slouch. It might be worth it to save the money, unless the 81-horsepower bump is too enticing for you to miss.
S6: Range-Topping Performance

The high-performance 2016 Audi S6 is up 30 horsepower compared with last year's model. Its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 now generates 450 horsepower. The 2016 S6 has a top speed of 155 mph and can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, according to Audi. The combination of luxury and performance is intoxicating, but it's also pricey. A base S6 costs around $71,000, which is enough for a nicely equipped Porsche Boxster S. Four-door practicality is an excellent feature, however. If you need the space of a luxury sedan with a bit of sports car athleticism, the S6 is an enticing choice.

A6 Pricing, Options, and Trims

The 2016 Audi A6 starts at $46,200. A few similarly sized luxury vehicles are cheaper. For instance, the Acura TLX starts at $31,700, and the Hyundai Genesis and Lexus ES both have base prices around $38,000. However, those vehicles have less luxurious interiors. The A6 is priced competitively with most of its main rivals. The Cadillac CTS and Lexus GS have similar starting prices. The BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class are $4,000 and $6,450 more, respectively.

The A6's main trim levels are 2.0T and 3.0T. They denote engine type. The 2.0T has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and the 3.0T has a supercharged 3.0-liter V6. There's also a performance-oriented S6 trim, which has a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8. Sub-trims (Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige) denote the number of comfort and convenience features the car has. Altogether, there are six trims: 2.0T Premium, 2.0T Premium Plus, 3.0T Premium Plus, 3.0T Prestige, S6 Premium Plus, and S6 Prestige. (Sales of the diesel-powered 3.0 TDI have been suspended due to the ongoing Volkswagen/Audi diesel emissions issues.)

A base 2.0T Premium costs $46,200 and comes with a good number of standard features, including leather upholstery, heated front seats, a sunroof, tri-zone automatic climate control, and Audi's MMI infotainment system, which features a 10-speaker audio system, satellite radio, and Bluetooth phone connectivity. However, a rearview camera and Bluetooth audio streaming are noticeably absent. You'll have to spend $3,100 on the Technology Package to get them. The $31,700 Acura TLX comes standard with both. The A6's Technology Package also includes front and rear parking sensors and an upgraded MMI infotainment system with a larger screen, navigation, a touchpad that lets you write out addresses with your finger, and a Wi-Fi hot spot.

Upgrading to the 2.0T Premium Plus ($49,900) gets you all of the features in the Technology Package, plus a few extra features, like power-folding side mirrors, blind spot monitoring (Side Assist), and rear cross traffic alert (Pre Sense Rear). You also get access to more options, like the premium Bose audio system ($850) and the Driver Assistance Package ($2,550), which includes adaptive cruise control, automatic pre-collision braking (Pre Sense Plus), lane keep assist, and a 360-degree parking camera system. Unless you're planning on getting the base A6 with no options, it's probably worth it to upgrade to the 2.0T Premium Plus.

All 2.0T models come standard with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is a $2,200 option.

The 3.0T Premium Plus has similar features to the 2.0T Premium Plus. The main difference is the 3.0T's more powerful supercharged V6 engine and standard all-wheel drive. The 3.0T Premium Plus costs $57,400, which is a $5,300 premium over the 2.0T Premium Plus with all-wheel drive.

The 3.0T Prestige ($61,600) adds more luxury features like ventilated front seats, a power trunk lid, and a head up display that projects onto the windshield. The Prestige also has exclusive options that aren't available in lower trims, including a night vision camera ($2,500) and a Bang & Olufsen sound system ($4,900).

The performance-oriented S6 models feature a powerful twin-turbocharged V8 engine, a sport-tuned suspension, stronger brakes, and sporty design details inside and out. The least expensive S6 is the S6 Premium Plus ($70,900), which commands a $13,500 premium over the 3.0T Premium Plus. Both models have similar comfort and convenience features, so you're mainly paying for the extra horsepower and cornering performance. The top-of-the-line S6 Prestige ($75,300) and the 3.0T Prestige also have similar comfort and convenience features.

A fully loaded A6 can cost upwards of $80,000, which is enough for the well-equipped and stylish A7, or the larger A8. That's also more than the base price of the Lexus LS and Jaguar XJ, which are in a higher price bracket than the A6.

A fully loaded S6 can top $90,000, which is Mercedes S-Class territory. The S-Class comes with a twin-turbocharged V8 and is considered by many to be the pinnacle of luxury among mainstream sedans.

A6 Safety and Reliability

The 2016 Audi A6 is one of the few vehicles to get perfect crash test scores from both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Like most modern luxury vehicles, the Audi A6 is available with a full suite of advanced safety features. However, you'll have to pay more for most of them. The base A6 only comes with Audi's Pre Sense Basic system, which detects when you're making an emergency maneuver and tightens the seatbelts. A rearview camera, which is standard in many rivals, including the $31,700 Acura TLX, is only available when you order the $3,100 Technology Package. Blind spot monitoring (Side Assist), rear cross traffic alert (Pre Sense Rear), automatic pre-collision braking (Pre Sense Plus), lane keep assist, and a 360-degree parking camera system are all available in higher trims.

The A6's predicted reliability rating is among the best in the class, so you shouldn't have to worry too much about expensive luxury car maintenance. Still, there are a few rivals with even more-impressive reliability scores, including the Mercedes E-Class and Lexus GS. The 2016 Audi A6 comes with a four-year/50,000-mile limited warranty.

Other Cars to Consider

The Cadillac CTS has responsive handling and a comfortable ride, especially when equipped with its optional Magnetic Ride Control suspension system. Potent engine options provide plenty of thrust on the highway; the CTS' base engine is even more powerful than the Audi's. The Cadillac CTS' stylish interior will make a great impression the next time you have to take clients to lunch.

The Lexus GS combines sharp handling with a smoother ride than you'll get in the A6. The GS' infotainment system can be a bit frustrating to use, but its luxurious interior appointments and comfortable front seats make it a pleasant place to while away a road trip. If you hate the sky-high service fees for luxury cars, the GS is a great choice. It has an even better predicted reliability rating than the A6, so repairs should be relatively minimal.
