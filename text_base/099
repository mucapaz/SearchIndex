Overview

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz A-Class is the German carmaker’s most affordable model offered here. A total of five variants are available beginning with the A180 Urban Line, priced at RM195, 888. For RM10, 000 more, the A 200 AMG Line can be yours. Next in the line up is the A250 that wears a starting price tag of RM238,888 and at the top of the variant tree is the fire breathing A45 AMG 4MATIC that will set you back a cool RM348, 888. The A-Class goes up against the Audi A3 Sportback and BMW 1-Series.

Under the hood of the A180 and A200 is a 1.6-litre turbocharged in-line four-cylinder engine. As a result of different tuning the turbo four-pot churns out 122hp/200Nm in the former and, 34hp and 50Nm more in the latter. As for the A250 Sport, a 2.0-litre turbocharged in-line four cylinder mill is found instead, with an output of 211hp at 5,500 rpm and 350Nm between 1,200 to 4,000 rpm. Both engines rely on a 7G-DCT dual clutch transmission to send power to the front wheels.

The A45 AMG on the other hand packs a 2.0-litre twin-scroll turbo four-pot that sends a massive 381hp and 475Nm through an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT seven-speed sports dual-clutch transmission to all four wheel permanently. Performance wise it can complete the century sprint in a very impressive 4.2 seconds, while top speed is limited to 250km/h.
