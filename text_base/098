Overview

The 2015 Audi A3 is the smallest saloon you can buy from the German carmaker here. It is sold in two variants with prices starting at RM179, 900 for the entry level 1.4 TFSI. The range topping 1.8 TFSI quattro variant commands RM58, 000 more. The A3 is underpinned by Volkswagen Group’s outstanding MQB architecture that is also found in cars like the Golf MK7 and third-generation Audi TT. Competition for the A3 sedan comes in the form of the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class and BMW 1-Series.

The entry-level variant is powered by a 1.4-litre turbocharged four-pot that produces 125hp and 200Nm of torque, paired to a seven-speed dry dual-clutch automatic transmission, which sends power to the front wheels. The range topper on the other hand packs a 1.8-litre turbo four and a six-speed wet dual-clutch automatic gearbox combo. Power is rated at 180hp and 280Nm of torque. The latter arrives at an early 1,350rpm and stay all the way up to 4,500rpm. The 1.8 TFSI variant is also equipped with the quattro all-wheel drive system, which means power is sent to all four corners.

The century sprint times for the 1.4 and 1.8 TFSI Audi A3 are rated at 9.3 and 6.8 seconds respectively. Fuel consumption for the entry level model is 4.9-litres/100km, while the more powerful range topper consumes 1.6-litres of petrol more for the same distance.

Standard across the range are Xenon headlights, LED daytime running lights, front and rear fog lamps, folding rear seats, 3D design inlays, electric front seats, a multifunction steering wheel, Audi Drive Select with five modes, light and rain sensor, cruise control and auto start/stop. Both cars are equipped with a ten speaker sound system and a 5.8-inch infotainment display that supports functions such as Bluetooth, CD, MP3, iPod and USB storage.

Reserved for the top of the line 1.8 TFSI are leather upholstery, sports front seats, paddle shifters, a sports suspension setup and parking system plus with selective display.

Both 2015 Audi A3 variants come packed with safety tech such as seven airbags, electronic stabilisation program, traction control, electronic differential lock, ABS with EBD and BA, as well as ISOFIX anchor points.
