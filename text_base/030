2016 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen Review

    Full Review Photos Prices Specs Performance Interior Safety Reliability 

By Nate Parsons July 18, 2016

The 2016 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen gives you as much cargo and passenger room as a compact SUV while maintaining the fuel efficiency and smooth ride of a car. The base model is one of the cheapest wagons in the class, yet our research shows that it has one of the nicest cabins in the class, along with plenty of features, including an infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

Some competitors, like the Subaru Outback, offer more room for your stuff. Others, like the Toyota Prius V, are more fuel-efficient. But overall, the Golf SportWagen is a solid choice if you're in the market for a wagon. It's even worth considering if you're looking at compact SUVs but want something with comfortable and athletic driving dynamics. 
Golf SportWagen Interior
Classy, Comfy Cabin

The 2016 Golf SportWagen has a contemporary and comfy cabin, fitted with higher-quality materials than those found in many competitors. Build quality is also excellent compared with other wagons. You can choose a black or beige interior in S and SE trims, while SEL models have either all black or two-tone black and gray.

The Golf SportWagen has seats for five on standard cloth upholstery. Higher trims come with leatherette upholstery. Up front, the seats have plenty of support to prevent fatigue, even on long trips. The back seats offer ample head- and legroom, but tall passengers may find that the low-mounted seat cushions don't provide enough thigh support, so if you have tall friends or family, you may be better served by a wagon with more back-seat room, like the Subaru Outback.
Ample Cargo Room

Few rivals can match the Golf SportWagen's cargo capacity: 30.4 cubic feet with the rear seats in use and 66.5 with them folded. In fact, the Golf SportWagen has more overall cargo room than many compact SUVs. Still, if you've got even more stuff than the SportWagen can handle, the Subaru Outback may be a better option, as it offers more cargo room, both with the seats folded and with them upright.

All Golf SportWagen trims come with 60/40 split-folding rear seats, giving you flexibility when hauling a mix of passengers and cargo. The release levers that let you lay down the rear seats are located in the cargo area, so they're easy to access when loading items. There's an under-floor storage cubby where you can hide your valuables or stow your grocery bags upright so they don't tip over.
High-Tech Features

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are new features with the Golf SportWagen's infotainment system for 2016, making it the first wagon in its price range to be available with either feature. They let you use some of your phone's apps, including navigation apps, through the infotainment system's touch screen, allowing you to skip the added cost of Volkswagen's built-in navigation system. The infotainment system responds quickly when you press a button on the touch screen.

A USB port is also new for 2016, and it replaces a proprietary cable that you had to buy from Volkswagen to connect your phone to the audio system in the previous model. Now you just use a standard USB cable to stream music playlists from your phone.

Speaking of music, all models come with satellite radio and HD Radio to give you access to a wide range of stations while you're on the go. A Fender premium audio system comes standard in all but the base trim, and it has impressive sound quality despite being on models with fairly low prices.

Golf SportWagen Performance
Adequate Engine Power

All Golf SportWagen models come with a turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower. Though many competitors make more power, the turbo four-cylinder should have no problem meeting your needs. It delivers plenty of power for quick acceleration as you pull away from a stoplight in the city or overtake other drivers on the freeway. Still, if you haul a full load of cargo and passengers, the engine will feel a bit more taxed at highway speeds. The Subaru Outback's optional 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine, on the other hand, delivers plenty of power for towing and hauling.

The base model comes standard with a five-speed manual transmission, while higher trims come with a six-speed automatic. Reviewers generally prefer the automatic transmission, saying it makes the most of the engine’s power.
Excellent Fuel Efficiency

When equipped with the automatic transmission, the 2016 Golf SportWagen gets 25 mpg around town and 35 mpg on the highway, which is better than what many rivals get. The Golf SportWagen diesel model is currently unavailable in the United States. If you are looking for an even more fuel-efficient wagon, the BMW 328d xDrive Sports Wagon or the Toyota Prius V are worth a look.
Comfy Cruising, Tight Turning

The Golf SportWagen's on-road manners should please most drivers. It's composed and comfortable when you're commuting to and from work, and when you take it out on the open road, it handles corners with ease. The Golf SportWagen's steering is sharp and responsive like the smaller Golf hatchback, making it nearly as easy to maneuver around the city or throw through turns as its smaller stablemate. The suspension soaks up most road imperfections to keep you and your passengers cushioned.

Golf SportWagen Pricing, Options, and Trims

Starting at $21,625, the base Golf SportWagen S comes standard with cloth upholstery, HD Radio, satellite radio, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, and a 6.5-inch touch-screen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration. A manual transmission is standard and an automatic transmission is a $1,100 option.

The SE trim, which is priced at $27,025, gets you leatherette upholstery, heated front seats, a panoramic sunroof, push-button start, a Fender premium audio system, rain-sensing wipers, and automatic headlights. The top-of-the-line SEL trim, starting at $29,385, is equipped with a 12-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, and navigation. An automatic transmission comes standard with both the SE and SEL trims.

You can further equip SE and SEL models with the optional Driver Assistance Package, which adds adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, front and rear parking sensors, and active park assist for $1,495.

Golf SportWagen Safety and Reliability

The 2016 Golf SportWagen hasn't been crash tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but it is available with a number of driver assistance features to prevent an accident before it happens. All models come with a rearview camera so you can easily see if there's anything behind you when you put the car in reverse.

The Driver Assistance Package adds several additional features, including forward collision warning, which warns you if you're following the car in front of you too closely and automatically applies the brakes if it senses a crash is imminent. Blind spot monitoring will alert you if there's a vehicle in the lane next to you, while lane departure warning lets you know if you drift over the lane line. When you back out of a parking space, rear cross traffic alert notifies you if another vehicle is approaching from the side.

The Golf SportWagen scores a below-average 2.5 out of five in the J.D. Power predicted reliability study, ranking behind many rivals. Volkswagen covers the Golf SportWagen with a three-year/36,000-mile new vehicle warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty.

Other Vehicles to Consider

The Subaru Outback has ample cargo room (even more than the Golf SportWagen) and a carlike ride. It comes standard with all-wheel drive to make sure you get to your destination, even in bad weather. Seats in both rows are roomy and comfortable, keeping you and your passengers happy. The Outback has fairly nimble handling, and while its base engine can feel underpowered at times, the optional six-cylinder has plenty of muscle even when the cabin is fully loaded.

Though it's not a wagon, the Honda CR-V is a highly rated compact car that gives you many of the benefits of owning a wagon. It has ample cargo space, and despite being an SUV, it has a low load floor that makes it easy to load like a wagon. The front seats are comfortable, while the rear seats are exceptionally spacious. The CR-V's engine is fuel-efficient and delivers quick acceleration. While not particularly athletic, the CR-V has a cushioned ride.
