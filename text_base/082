Overview

BMW Malaysia’s answer to compact sports coupes like the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class line up and Audi A3 Sedan (even if they have four doors) is the 2016 2 Series Coupe. It is sold here in the 220i and M2 guise, priced at RM257, 800 and RM498, 800 respectively. A RM20, 000 Sport Line package is also on offer for customers who want to spice up their 220i Coupe with some sporty touches.

Powering the entry-level variant is a turbocharged 2.0-litre BMW TwinPower four-cylinder engine that produces 184hp and 270Nm of torque. The latter arrives at an early 1,250rpm to offer easy driveability around city traffic and aid fuel consumption. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. As a result the 2016 BMW 220i only sips 6.0 litres of fuel to complete 100km, while also managing to complete the century sprint in seven seconds flat before topping off at 230km/h.

Under the hood of the M Divison tuned M2 lies the carmaker's turbocharged 3.0-litre N55 six-cylinder mill that pumps out 370hp and 465Nm of torque. The standard transmission choice for Malaysian-bound cars will be the seven-speed M DCT transmission, which will enable the M2 to complete the century sprint in just 4.2 seconds, while top speed is electronically capped at 250km/h. Besides that, there is also an Active M Differential to ensure that power is put to the gorund in the most efficient way possible.
