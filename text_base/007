Classics, models and race cars to join GT-R Nismo

Nissan will be in California this month for the 12th annual Japanese Classic Car Show. The automaker plans to display the car that first put them in the racing winning circle, the No. 46 Datsun 510 by Brock Racing Enterprises, and its latest winner, the No. 05 Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3. But the main attraction of JCCS will be the debut of the street-legal 2017 GT-R Nismo.

The GT-R Nismo made its world debut in May at the Nurburgring, and it didn’t disappoint. Like the previous model, the sports car is equipped with a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6, which still produces 600 hp. The AWD system has been updated, along with the interior. The layout has been improved, as well. Nissan updated the navigation, reduced the number of knobs from 27 to 11 and added a new Display Command console.

More than 7,000 spectators are expected to attend JCCS, and there will be more than 350 classic and unique cars. Highlights include the first public showing of a new 1:64-scale model 1971 Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-X coupe from Matchbox, a 1969 Nissan Patrol, the new 2017 Armada, 1962 Nissan Fairlady and a modified 1971 Nissan “Hakosuka” GT-R tribute vehicle.

The event takes place Saturday, Sept. 24 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Harry Bridges Memorial Park at the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. Nissan plans to give away a bunch of prizes, including some of the new Matchbox models. More details will be released throughout September. Look for the hashtag NissanAtJCCS for additional information regarding the show and giveaways.
