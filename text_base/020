By Courtney Jones April 18, 2016

Reviewers agree that the 2016 Lexus GS Hybrid has a luxurious interior, potent acceleration and excellent fuel economy estimates, but its infotainment system isn't user-friendly.

The 2016 Lexus GS Hybrid has the best combination of interior space, safety and reliability ratings, and available family-friendly features in its class, making it our 2016 Best Hybrid Car for Families.

Performance Summary

The 2016 Lexus GS 450h is powered by a V6 engine and two electric motors that reviewers agree produce an abundance of power and rapid acceleration. An automatic transmission (CVT) is standard. They add that the GS Hybrid is faster than the non-hybrid GS sedan while maintaining superior fuel economy estimates.

According to the EPA, the GS 450h earns 29/34 mpg city/highway, which is excellent for a midsize sedan. Reviewers are pleased with the GS 450h's smooth ride and composed handling. The majority of test drivers think the GS 450h's regenerative brakes work well.

Interior Summary

Auto writers commend the 2016 Lexus GS 450h for its luxurious interior, noting its premium materials and excellent build quality. They report that the GS 450h's front seats are supportive, and its back seats have good head- and legroom for adults. The GS 450h's trunk is small for an upscale midsize car, but adequate for a hybrid sedan.

Standard features include a moonroof, push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a rearview camera, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, Siri Eyes Free integration, a 12-speaker surround-sound stereo, satellite radio, a USB port, Bluetooth and an infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen. Optional features include a head-up display, parallel parking assist, active lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic braking, a pedestrian detection system, driver drowsiness monitoring, a 17-speaker Mark Levinson surround-sound audio system and an upgraded infotainment system with navigation, a 12.3-inch screen and the Lexus Enform App Suite, which connects with your smartphone to allow you to control apps like Pandora Internet radio via the infotainment screen. The infotainment system is operated by using a mouse-like Remote Touch controller that critics say is difficult to use. They also dislike that there are no redundant physical buttons, forcing you to use the controller to adjust infotainment functions.
