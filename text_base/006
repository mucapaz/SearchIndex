Striped Shelby GTE looks the part, but lacks performance of the GT350

At this year’s Mustang Club of America meeting at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Shelby lifted the sheet off its latest modified Mustang. Dubbed the Shelby GTE, the new addition to the lineup isn’t a direct competitor with the potent Shelby GT350 or GT350R; however, it does replace the need to buy a Hertz-spec rental car after it’s retired from lots.

Essentially, the Shelby GTE is an aggressive-looking Ford Mustang GT with some minor performance upgrades. Available with the 2.3-liter EcoBoost I4 or the 5.0-liter DOHC V8, the GTE will get a Ford Performance exhaust, the Ford handling package and 19-inch wheels. The more obvious changes are the aggressively vented Shelby hood, carbon fiber front splitter and rear spoiler and Shelby logos on the car’s interior and exterior.

Unlike the similarly styled Hertz, this Shelby can come as either a convertible or a fastback and with your choice of automatic or manual transmissions. According to Shelby, this package will tack $17,995 to the bottom line of a base GT's $33,545 price tag -- putting it nearly in Shelby GT350 territory of $56,495.
