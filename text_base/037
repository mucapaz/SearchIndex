By Cody Trotter April 19, 2016

Critics say the electric 2016 BMW i3 has a comfortable interior, ample power and surprisingly sporty handling.

Performance Summary

The 2016 BMW i3 features an electric motor that delivers good pickup from a stop and adequate acceleration at speed. The base i3 earns an EPA-estimated 137/111 mpg-equivalent city/highway, which makes it more efficient than many rival electric vehicles.

The base i3 has a range of 81 miles on a fully charged battery. The i3 with Range Extender trim adds a two-cylinder gasoline engine that acts as a generator to charge the battery. The i3 delivers nimble handling and precise steering, though the steering offers little road feedback. The regenerative brakes are strong and slow the car noticeably just by letting off the gas pedal. They work well in heavy traffic once drivers get used to their feel.

Interior Summary

The i3 has an attractive interior with quality materials, many of which are made from recycled or renewable resources. The front seats are comfortable and the back seats provide ample head- and legroom. The rear-hinged doors make getting in and out of the vehicle easier for most people, but a high step into the car may be problematic for some passengers. The infotainment system is intuitive and responsive, however the i3's shifter can make it tricky to identify which gear you're in. The i3 has more cargo space than many electric vehicles.

Standard features in the i3 include automatic climate control, push-button start, Bluetooth, HD Radio, satellite radio, a USB port, adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors and the iDrive infotainment system with navigation and a 6.5-inch display screen. Available features include a 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, a rearview camera, parallel park assist, front and rear parking sensors, forward collision warning and collision mitigation.

Other Cars to Consider

The Chevrolet Volt delivers strong acceleration and an engaging driving experience. It has a longer total driving range than the i3, although the Volt's mpg-e rating is lower than the i3's. The Volt also features a lower starting price than the i3.

The Nissan Leaf is quiet and has poised handling. Its mpg-e rating is nearly as good as the i3's, and its all-electric range is slightly greater. Spacious rear seats and user-friendly tech features are the hallmarks of its stylish interior.
