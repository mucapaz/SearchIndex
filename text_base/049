Station Wagons 2016-2017: The Best and the Rest
These are the winners of our Editors' Choice awards for the best station wagons of 2016 and 2017. If you're looking for an alternative to an SUV, crossover, or minivan, a station wagon is a great option.
Editors' Choice*
Compacts

    Subaru Impreza
    MSRP: $19,090 - $24,390
    EPA: 25 city/34 hwy
    Overview: Sensible, spacious, and trustworthy—these traits make the Impreza a safe choice, but not an exciting one.

Entry-luxury Cars

    BMW 3-series
    MSRP: $34,145 - $50,195
    EPA: 23 city/35 hwy
    Overview: At one time, the 3-series was the benchmark for all sports sedans, but its once uncompromised tactility has been slightly softened in this latest generation.

Hybrid Vehicles

    Toyota Prius V
    MSRP: $27,540 - $31,800
    EPA: 44 city/40 hwy
    Overview: Blending the usefulness of a station wagon and the fuel economy of a hybrid, the Prius V might be the ultimate utility vehicle.

Premium Sports Sedans

    Mercedes-AMG E63 S 4MATIC
    MSRP: $102,625 - $105,225
    EPA: 15 city/22 hwy
    Overview: Absurd power and blistering acceleration are not the E63’s only party tricks; thanks to computer magic and an excellent suspension, it’s also quite agile.

Station Wagons

    Audi A4 Allroad Quattro
    MSRP: $43,625
    EPA: 21 (Est) city/28 (Est) hwy
    Overview: As a butched-up wagon, the Allroad lacks true off-roadability, but as all-weather transport, it hits the mark.
    Volkswagen Golf SportWagen
    MSRP: $22,445 - $30,205
    EPA: 25 (Est) city/36 (Est) hwy
    Overview: Take the goodness of the Golf, mix it with the added utility of a wagon, and the satisfying result is the Golf SportWagen.
    Fiat 500L
    MSRP: $20,490 - $25,790
    EPA: 22 city/30 hwy
    Overview: The 500L features styling that’s adorable to many but a bit too squee-worthy to others.
    Mercedes-Benz E-class Wagon
    MSRP: $60,825
    EPA: 20 city/27 hwy
    Overview: Exceptionally quiet, extremely practical, and exceedingly comfortable, the E-class wagon is the luxury SUV for car people.
    Mini Cooper Clubman
    MSRP: $24,950
    EPA: 25 (Est) city/34 (Est) hwy
    Overview: More like the “maxi” from Mini, the Clubman still offers sporty handling and peppy performance.
    Mini Cooper Clubman S / JCW
    MSRP: $28,500
    EPA: 23 (Est) city/33 (Est) hwy
    Overview: Sports-car athleticism and cheeky styling are hallmarks of the Mini brand; cargo space isn’t, so here’s the Clubman S with up to 48 cubic feet of storage.
    Volvo V60
    MSRP: $37,090 - $61,840
    EPA: 25 city/36 hwy
    Overview: Handsome styling and a sloping roofline make the V60 more a stylish hatchback than conventional station wagon.
    Volvo V90
    MSRP: N/A
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: Compromising style for utility can often lead to uninspiring results, but luckily the V90 manages to offer a lot of both.
