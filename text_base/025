2016 Porsche Cayman Review

    Full Review Photos Prices Specs Performance Interior Safety Reliability 

By Colin Aylesworth April 19, 2016

Test drivers agree that the 2016 Porsche Cayman is one of the most thrilling sports cars available, thanks to its dynamic handling and precise steering.

Performance Summary

The 2016 Cayman comes standard with a 2.7-liter six-cylinder engine that has underwhelming passing power. For a more thrilling driving experience and stronger acceleration, step up to one of the more-powerful six-cylinder engines in the S, GTS or GT4 trims. A six-speed manual transmission is standard. All but the GT4 trim are available with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.

The base Cayman gets an EPA-estimated 20/30 mpg city/highway, which is very good for a six-cylinder sports car. No matter which trim you select, the Cayman delivers a fun driving experience, with athletic handling and sharp steering. Ride quality is generally good, although the top GTS and GT4 trims have a stiffer ride, as do lower-trim models fitted with 20-inch wheels.

Interior Summary

The Porsche Cayman's cockpit is constructed with top-quality materials. Although outward visibility is poor, the Cayman's two seats are both supportive and comfortable. The Cayman has two trunks – one in the front and one in the rear – and there is sufficient luggage space for a weekend trip. The Cayman's center stack has lots of buttons, but they are easy to use.

Standard features include a 7-inch touch screen, Bluetooth and a four-speaker audio system that delivers disappointing sound quality.

Optional features include a 10-speaker Bose or 12-speaker Burmester audio system, satellite radio, a USB port, dual-zone automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and navigation.

Other Cars to Consider

The Jaguar F-Type delivers strong acceleration whether you choose its base supercharged V6 or its optional 550-horsepower supercharged V8. The F-Type also has athletic handling and a sporty cockpit design.

The base Chevrolet Corvette Stingray is very fast, and the supercharged Z06 model delivers supercar levels of acceleration and power. The Corvette coupe has one of the most practical cargo areas in the class due to its hatchback design.
