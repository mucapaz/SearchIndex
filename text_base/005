3.2-liter V8-engined luxury sedan was one of just a dozen built in RHD

When we think of classic BMWs, one of the Neue Klasse models usually pops into our minds. Or perhaps an Isetta or a 507; two very different classics. But before the Neue Klasse models defined BMW for decades, the German automaker struggled to find its niche in the post-war years, experimenting with luxurious sedans that aimed squarely for Mercedes-Benz models.

And this weekend, Silverstone Auctions will offer a piece of that history; a 1957 BMW 502 3.2 V8 sedan in "barn find" condition that has been hiding in the U.K.

What were the 502 sedans about? The second all-new post-war BMW design, the 502 sought to correct the shortcomings of the 501 sedan which was powered by a six-cylinder engine that wasn't up to the task; the 501 was a commercial flop. Debuting at the 1954 Geneva motor show the 502 offered slightly revised exterior styling and a 3.2-liter V8 that the company hoped would allow it to compete directly with the Mercedes-Benz "Ponton" sedans of the time, which featured equally curvy exteriors. The 501 and 502 were nicknamed "Baroque Angels" for their slightly overstyled appearance.

BMW blew out 100 candles this year, and the celebration of the automaker's centenary extended to Monterey Car Week events as well. Fresh from showing the 2002 Hommage concept in Turbomeister ...

BMW's first post-war V8, the 502 turned out to be more of a success than the 501, though it was still eyewateringly expensive. Total production from 1954 through 1958 amounted to just 3,865 units, making the "Barockengel" a contrarian choice for everyone but the West German government.

But someone in the U.K. had a deep desire to own one of these; an unpopular choice in post-war Britain, especially given the abundance of British sedans in this class. Silverstone says that this is one of just 12 examples that BMW built in right-hand drive, making it one of the least produced RHD versions of mass-produced cars.

This particular example's early history is not well-known, though Silverstone states that this 502 was bought by the founder of a BMW dealership in the 1970s, which went on to restore the car. The auction house reports that following the restoration this 502 won the Munich Cup at the BMW International Concours d' Elegance in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1986, inexplicably retiring from regular use in 1991 with 86,082 miles on the clock. The car appears to have been in storage for the past 25 years in not-particularly good conditions, and now shows surface rust and staining on the outside. The interior appears to be in better shape, but will still require some restoration efforts. The auction houses is silent on the condition of the drivetrain, only noting that the car is largely complete and is offered in "barn find" condition. Silverstone also does not say whether it has been started recently.

We sometimes wonder how many owners of the BMW Z4 would recognize a BMW 507 in traffic today. With just 252 examples built between 1956 and 1959 and even fewer remaining, the 507 is one of the rarest ...

Silverstone will offer this forgotten 502 at no reserve. We have a feeling that this car may not stay in the U.K., given the rarity of its RHD configuration and the expanding interest in early post-war BMW models.
