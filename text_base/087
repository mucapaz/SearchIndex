Overview

The 2015 Mazda 5 is a people carrier that features a Skyactiv engine and transmission but doesn’t adopt the Hiroshima based carmaker’s KODO design inspired looks. Bermaz Motors sells the car here in a sole variant for a price of RM153, 018.50. The fully imported seven-seater 5 rivals models like the Honda Stream, Peugeot 5008, Citroen Grand C4 Picasso, Mazda Biante, and Nissan Serena S-Hybrid.

Under the hood of the 2015 Mazda 5 is a naturally aspirated 2.0-litre four-cylinder Double Overhead Cam Skyactiv-G engine that produces 149hp at 6,000rpm and 190Nm of torque at 4,100 rpm. A six-speed torque converter type automatic gearbox is employed to send the power to the front wheels. According to Mazda, the 5 is capable of returning a fuel economy figure of 6.6-litres per 100km. 

In terms of kit this seven-seat Japanese MPV comes with 16-inch alloy wheels, automatic on/off halogen headlights, front fog lights, side mirror integrated turn signals, a sunroof, power sliding doors, a sports body kit as well as a rear spoiler that enhances the overall look of the car.

Besides that, there are bells and whistles such as automatic climate control, second row air-cond vents, auto start/stop function, a leather wrapped tilt and telescopic adjustable steering wheel with functional switches, reverse sensors, keyless entry and Mazda’s highly praised Karakuri seats.

The MPV also benefits from a seven-inch infotainment system that features four speakers, CD, DVD, MP3 and USB compatibility. Two headrest monitors are also present to keep the rear passengers entertained throughout the journey.

With regards to its safety features, the 2015 Mazda 5 makes no compromise. It comes packed with Anti-lock Brakes (ABS), Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), a traction control system, and two airbags.
