By Courtney Jones April 18, 2016

According to critics, the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid’s ride is comfortable, its powertrain smooth, and its fuel efficiency class-leading, but its trunk is small, and the interior material quality disappoints.

Performance Summary

Powering the 2016 Malibu Hybrid are a four-cylinder engine and two electric motors. The Malibu Hybrid transitions seamlessly between gas and electric power, and unlike most hybrid cars, its regenerative brakes are smooth and provide consistent pedal feel. Performance-wise, there’s little difference between this and the gas-only model. Still, the Malibu Hybrid's engine can be noisy under hard acceleration, even though interior soundproofing keeps most of the noise outside.

Chevrolet estimates that the Malibu Hybrid gets 48/45 mpg city/highway, making it one of the most fuel-efficient cars in the class, even among other hybrids. The 2016 Malibu Hybrid's ride feels gentle and serene over most surfaces, and its steering is well-weighted.

Interior Summary

The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid's interior features a stylish new dashboard layout, and its low position creates an expansive view of the road. However, the Malibu Hybrid's interior material quality remains unremarkable. Front seats are comfortable, and the rear seats have ample legroom for taller passengers, but the sloped rear roofline yields limited headroom for passengers and poor blind-spot visibility for the driver.

The 2016 Malibu Hybrid comes with a rearview camera, Chevy's MyLink Radio with a 7-inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 4G LTE with Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required), cruise control, and push-button start. Optional features include an 8-inch touch screen, blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, semi-automatic parking assist, front and rear park assist, rear cross traffic alert, lane keep assist, front pedestrian braking, and low-speed automatic front braking.

The touch-screen menus feature large icons and bright graphics. The screen sits high on the dashboard and is easy for drivers to see and reach. If you share the family car with a new driver, the available Teen Driver system encourages safe driving by monitoring driving habits. The Malibu Hybrid's trunk is smaller than most in the class.
