Overview

The 2016 BMW 1 Series is the most affordable model in the Bavarian carmaker's line-up. The Mercedes-Benz A-Class- and Audi A3-rivalling vehicle is sold here in two variants, the 118i Sport and 120i M Sport with a starting price tag for RM173, 800. 

Under the hood of the entry-level 118i is a 1.5-litre TwinPower Turbo petrol engine that supplies 136hp and 220Nm of torque that enables this car to do 0-100km/h in 8.7 seconds, while returning a fuel consumption figure of just 5.1-litre per 100km.

The pricier M-Sport goodies equipped 120i is powered by a 1.6-litre direct injected turbo four-cylinder engine that sends 177hp and 250Nm to the rear wheels. 0-100km/h time is rated at 7.2 seconds, while the top speed is 222km/h. The German carmaker claims that the 2016 BMW 120i M Sport will only sip 5.9-litres per 100km. The Malaysian-market BMW 1 Series variants are exclusively available with an eight-speed automatic transmission only.
