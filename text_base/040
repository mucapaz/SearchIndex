Hybrid and Electric Cars 2016-2017: The Best and the Rest
Looking to buy a hybrid or an electric vehicle to help save gasoline and maybe the planet? The vehicles sporting an Editors' Choice badge are our picks for the best hybrids and best EVs of 2016 and 2017.
Editors' Choice*
Hybrid Vehicles

    Chevrolet Volt
    MSRP: $33,995 - $38,345
    EPA: 53 city/45 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: Despite the Volt’s eco image, it’s actually fun to drive, without the range anxiety of pure electric vehicles.
    Audi A3 Sportback e-tron
    MSRP: $38,825
    EPA: 86 city/86 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: A pleasing blend of hybrid and hatchback, the A3 e-tron gives you Audi cachet and power, plus an EPA-rated 83–86 MPGe.
    Ford C-Max
    MSRP: $25,045 - $32,645
    EPA: 42 city/37 hwy
    Overview: While comfortable and fun to drive, the C-Max’s high EPA-estimated fuel-economy numbers are basically fantasy.
    Honda CR-Z
    MSRP: $21,130 - $25,925
    EPA: 31 city/38 hwy
    Overview: The CR-Z is an ambitious attempt at making a sporty hybrid, but its performance doesn’t match its adventurous styling.
    Hyundai Ioniq
    MSRP: TBD
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: The Ioniq is not on sale yet, but here’s what we know.
    Lexus CT
    MSRP: $32,225
    EPA: 43 city/40 hwy
    Overview: If you’re into the relentless pursuit of fuel efficiency—but you can’t take the doorstop style of the Toyota Prius—the CT200h may be what you seek.
    Toyota Prius
    MSRP: $25,065 - $30,865
    EPA: 54 city/50 hwy
    Overview: With its combination of space and efficiency, the Prius is quite compelling—in our experience, 50 mpg is achievable, even at near-80-mph speeds.
    Toyota Prius C
    MSRP: $20,425 - $25,360
    EPA: 53 (Est) city/46 (Est) hwy
    Overview: Take the uninspired underpinnings of the Toyota Yaris and mix with it an even less powerful version of the Prius hybrid powertrain and you get the Prius C.
    Toyota Prius V
    MSRP: $27,540 - $31,800
    EPA: 44 city/40 hwy
    Overview: Blending the usefulness of a station wagon and the fuel economy of a hybrid, the Prius V might be the ultimate utility vehicle.

Electric Vehicles

    Chevrolet Spark EV
    MSRP: $25,995 - $26,385
    EPA: 128 city/109 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: The Spark EV dials in some much needed fun by improving just about everything wrong with its gas-powered counterpart.
    Kia Soul EV
    MSRP: $32,800 - $36,800
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: The funky Soul EV appeals to the eco-friendly, keeps the utility of the gas-powered Soul, and adds a host of tech features to please even the geekiest hamsters.
    Volkswagen e-Golf
    MSRP: $29,815 - $36,415
    EPA: 126 city/105 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: Sporting most of the excellence of its gasoline-powered counterpart, the e-Golf zaps its way into a growing field of affordable electrics.
    Chevrolet Bolt EV
    MSRP: $37,500
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: Quick on its feet and fun to toss around, the Bolt EV is an affordable and enjoyable electric car worth waiting for.
    Fiat 500E
    MSRP: $32,795
    EPA: 122 city/108 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: With its tiny size, zippy handling, and an EPA range of 87 miles, the 500E is a fine city car—as long as you don’t need to go anywhere else.
    Ford Focus Electric
    MSRP: $30,045
    EPA: 110 city/99 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: You might miss the exhaust note, but otherwise the Focus Electric is very similar to its gasoline-powered sibling.
    Honda Clarity
    MSRP: $60,000
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: Powered by hydrogen and emitting only water as its exhaust, the Clarity brings you the future today.
    Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell
    MSRP: N/A
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: Never visit a gas station again—except for a bag of Fritos, maybe—with the hydrogen-fueled Tucson Fuel Cell.
    Mitsubishi i-MiEV
    MSRP: $23,845
    EPA: 126 city/99 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: No, it’s not a larger-than-life computer mouse; it’s the i-MiEV, the least-expensive EV sold.
    Nissan Leaf
    MSRP: $29,860 - $37,640
    EPA: 124 city/101 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: The Leaf’s earth-friendly image, relaxed ride, and spacious cabin make it an affordable EV with everyday usability.
    Smart Fortwo Electric Drive
    MSRP: $25,750
    EPA: 122 city/93 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: The Smart Fortwo ED should be the most logical and painless of the EV conversions, but we have tested it and found it lacking.
    Tesla Model 3
    MSRP: $35,000
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: Touted as the affordable electric sports sedan, the Model 3 is Tesla’s eco-friendly gift to the motoring masses.
    Toyota Mirai
    MSRP: $58,365
    EPA: 67 city/67 hwy
    Overview: In Japanese, “mirai” means “future,” and the Mirai is the future of motoring: It runs solely on hydrogen and its only emissions are water.

Entry-luxury Electric Vehicles

    BMW i3
    MSRP: $43,395 - $47,245
    EPA: 127 city/107 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: With its carbon-fiber/aluminum structure and electric powertrain, the i3 advances BMW’s legendary driving dynamics into the future.

    MSRP: $42,375
    EPA: 85 city/83 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: The B-class puts some juice into the legendary three-pointed star, making for a truly electrifying experience.

Luxury Hybrid and Electric Vehicles

    BMW i8
    MSRP: $141,695
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: Three pistons combusting internally, a dollop of electrons and lots of aluminum and carbon fiber are the main ingredients for the i8.
    Tesla Model S
    MSRP: $71,200 - $109,200
    EPA: 89 city/98 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: Boasting up to 315 miles of range, the Model S is the all-electric dream car envied by many.
    Cadillac ELR
    MSRP: $65,995
    EPA: 90 city/90 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: It’s astonishing to look at, beautifully crafted inside and out, and the first electric-hybrid Cadillac since…ever.
    Tesla Model X
    MSRP: $81,200 - $116,700
    EPA: 89 city/90 hwy (MPGe)
    Overview: The Model X might be the greenest—and fastest—way to tote up to 7 people over hill and dale.
