Pickup Trucks 2016-2017: The Best and the Rest
If you've got stuff to haul or tow, you'll definitely want to take a look at our choices for the best full-size pickup trucks and best mid-size pickup trucks of 2016 and 2017. If you see one wearing an Editors' Choice badge, you'll know we consider it to be one of the best trucks you can buy.
Editors' Choice*
Full-size Pickup Trucks

    Chevrolet Silverado 1500
    MSRP: $28,390 - $54,610
    EPA: 18 city/24 hwy
    Overview: Modern pickups are amenity-packed multitasking machines—and the Silverado is no exception.
    Ford F-150
    MSRP: $27,735 - $63,505
    EPA: 18 (Est) city/25 (Est) hwy
    Overview: The legendary F-150—now with an aluminum bed and body—remains the hard-working pickup it’s always been.
    GMC Sierra 1500
    MSRP: $29,010 - $55,835
    EPA: 18 city/24 hwy
    Overview: The Sierra aims to present itself as a more upscale, premium version of the Chevrolet Silverado—but beneath the GMC’s sculpted sheetmetal and nicer trim, the two are basically the same.
    Ram 1500
    MSRP: $27,340 - $53,860
    EPA: 17 (Est) city/25 (Est) hwy
    Overview: From work truck to leather-lined luxury rig, the 1500’s smooth ride, comfortable seats and ample storage space make it a tool worth your consideration.
    Ford F-150 Raptor
    MSRP: $49,520 - $52,505
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: Move over, Kid Rock: The F-150 Raptor is the new American badass, and it will be unleashed this fall.
    Nissan Titan
    MSRP: $35,975 - $49,655
    EPA: 13 city/18 hwy
    Overview: Long relegated to the back of the pack, the Titan has new duds that finally give it a fighting chance.
    Toyota Tundra
    MSRP: $30,335 - $50,775
    EPA: 15 city/19 hwy
    Overview: Try as it might, the Tundra is not quite up to the challenge of the competition despite its bold styling and a handsomely finished interior.

Heavy Duty Pickup Trucks

    Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD
    MSRP: $34,150 - $58,130
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: Whether at the work site or on the open road, the Silverado 2500HD has the brawn to tackle just about anything.
    Ford F-250 Super Duty
    MSRP: $33,580 - $58,435
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: Brutish power and payload capacity remain key traits of the F-250, while aluminum construction brings it into the 21st century.
    GMC Sierra 2500HD
    MSRP: $34,730 - $58,985
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: The Sierra 2500 HD shares its chassis with the Chevy Silverado 2500 HD but wears Prada instead of work boots.
    Nissan Titan XD
    MSRP: $36,485 - $61,715
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: Its half-ton size and almost-three-quarter-ton capability make the Titan XD the right size for many shoppers.
    Ram 2500
    MSRP: $32,975 - $58,480
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: The workhorse 2500 is available in an array of configurations ranging from the base Tradesman to the deluxe Power Wagon Laramie.
    Ram Power Wagon
    MSRP: TBD
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: Based on the three-quarter-ton Ram 2500 crew cab, the Power Wagon returns with more mud on its tires as Ram’s top off-roader.

Mid-size Pickup Trucks

    Chevrolet Colorado
    MSRP: $20,995 - $36,195
    EPA: 19 city/26 hwy
    Overview: The quiet, clever, and capable Colorado offers nearly as much utility as full-size pickups—minus the lane-hogging size.
    GMC Canyon
    MSRP: $21,880 - $39,035
    EPA: 19 city/26 hwy
    Overview: The Canyon shares far too much with its downmarket twin, the Chevrolet Colorado, to be deemed truly upscale.
    Honda Ridgeline
    MSRP: $30,375 - $43,770
    EPA: 19 city/26 hwy
    Overview: The Ridgeline’s roomy cabin, ample storage, smooth ride, and innovative touches make its rivals seem outdated.
    Jeep Wrangler Pickup
    MSRP: $30,000 (est.)
    EPA: TBD
    Overview: Said to debut in late 2017, the much-anticipated Wrangler Pickup is a natural addition to the Jeep lineup.
    Nissan Frontier
    MSRP: $19,190 - $37,010
    EPA: 19 city/23 hwy
    Overview: The old stone that is the Frontier keeps rolling—its basic design dates to 2005, it’s had only minimal changes since 2009, and a replacement probably won’t arrive for a few more years.
    Toyota Tacoma
    MSRP: $24,600 - $39,120
    EPA: 19 city/23 hwy
    Overview: The Tacoma’s ruggedly handsome looks and available off-road gear don’t really make up for its tight interior and so-so fuel economy.

Ultra Heavy Duty Pickup Trucks

    Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD
    MSRP: $35,250 - $58,280
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: The 3500 HD is the king of Chevy pickups, offering a trailer-towing capacity of up to 23,200 pounds and a maximum payload of 7153 pounds.
    Ford F-350 Super Duty
    MSRP: $33,935 - $60,535
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: The only Ford pickup with a choice of single or dual rear wheels, the F-350 is available in a range of permutations so you can tailor it to the job at hand.
    GMC Sierra 3500HD
    MSRP: $35,830 - $59,320
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: The Sierra 3500 HD is the ultimate luxury workhorse, with its high-line interior and lofty towing/hauling numbers—call it a Taj Mahauler.
    Ram 3500
    MSRP: $33,480 - $59,470
    EPA: N/A
    Overview: With a massive 31,210-pound towing capacity, the 3500 could possibly be the hardest-working pickup truck on Earth.
