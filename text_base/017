    Full Review Photos Prices Specs Performance Interior Safety Reliability 

By Colin Aylesworth May 20, 2016

The 2016 Honda Fit surpasses rivals with its flexible cargo hold, roomy interior and great fuel economy, test drivers report. 

With the best combination of positive reviews and long-term ownership costs in its classes, the Honda Fit is both our 2016 Subcompact Car for the Money and Best Hatchback for the Money.

Performance Summary

The 2016 Honda Fit is powered by a four-cylinder engine which test drivers say has good power for driving around town, but can feel sluggish on the highway. It comes standard with a manual transmission, and a continuously variable transmission (automatic) is optional.

Fuel economy is up to an EPA-estimated 33/41 mpg city/highway, which is excellent for the class. Test drivers agree that the Fit feels composed when cornering and rides comfortably over rough roads.

Interior Summary

Reviewers write that the 2016 Honda Fit's cabin is built with upscale materials for a subcompact car. They find that rear-seat legroom is generous for the class and they're impressed with its roomy cargo hold and versatile cargo-carrying capability.

Standard features include a USB port, Bluetooth and a rearview camera. Available features include HD Radio, satellite radio, a 7-inch touch-screen audio display, navigation and a blind spot camera. Reviewers report that the available touch screen operates quickly but dislike that there isn't a dedicated knob for adjusting audio volume.

Other Cars to Consider

Though it lacks the cargo-carrying versatility of the Fit, the Ford Fiesta earns praise for its nimble handling and attractive cabin. Auto writers especially like the ST model, which they say feels remarkably powerful compared to rivals and is fun to drive.

Reviewers agree that the Kia Rio's audio controls and infotainment system are easy to master. They also write that its standard four-cylinder engine delivers ample power, and although it can't match the Fit's EPA numbers, the Rio gets good fuel economy for the class.
