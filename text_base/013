The 2017 Porsche Macan Turbo, with the new Performance package, will sprint to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. Think about that for a minute. That's almost as fast as the original R8, and it’s faster than a 2015 Mustang GT.

The 2017 Macan Turbo gets a “newly calibrated” twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V6 making 400 hp. Adding the Performance pack bumps that up to 440 hp and drops that sprint time by .2 second. Top speed is 169 mph with the package and torque goes up to 442 lb-ft from 406 lb-ft.

The base Macan Turbo is $77,050, including $1,050 for destination. The Performance pack bumps that up to $87,495, but for that you get the ultimate in Porsche small SUV performance.

The 2017 Porsche Macan Turbo with Performance Package has a top speed of 169 mph.

In addition to the power upgrades above, buyers get a new brake system, a lower chassis, the Sport Chrono package and a sport exhaust system. The front brakes are about an inch bigger, and the calipers are painted red.

PASM, Porsche active stability management, is also included. The system lowers the car and stiffens up the suspension.

Optional equipment includes 21-inch 911 Turbo design wheels, LED headlights equipped with Porsche Dynamic Light System Plus, and other black styling elements.

The Macan Turbo with Performance package is available to order now.
